# Bootcamp2018

## Welcome to our very first workshop/boot camp! 

In this session, you will learn the basics of Ethereum and its development language, Solidity!

We will go through small intricacies, explaining how things work and how they connect together,
going through somewhat simplistic examples to more complex ones!

Hope you enjoy your time here and please, access the resources at your own pace!

Once we are done with the day, we would really appreciate if you would complete this survey in order for us to improve the quality of our programs! *Please keep in mind that this is all freely run by an open-source community!*
